## Introduction

> Golf Revolution is a 3D MiniGolf game made on Unity, based on open-source assets.
Maps are randomly generated.

Assets can be found for free on Kenney.nl :
-	https://kenney.nl/assets/minigolf-pack
-	https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack
-	https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-audio

## Know Issues

Rare : 
Map generations without holes : Think about cases with 2 walls floor with hole.
Ball going through walls : Continuous collision makes the ball hit the prefabs, redesign the prefabs?
