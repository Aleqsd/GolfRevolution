You control the forces put on the ball using the arrow keys of your keyboard or the ZQSD
A jump can be done during the shoot by pressing Space.

Maps are created with specials fields like holes, gaps, windmill, castles ...

### Sounds, particles !

## Know Issues

Common :
-

Rare : 
Map generations without holes : Think about cases with 2 walls floor with hole.
Ball going through walls : Continuous collision makes the ball hit the prefabs, redesign the prefabs?
Arrow popping in the wrong position : Find how to reproduce

## Future feature

Adaptative Camera : Add a camera that not only follow the ball, but find the right direction hinting you the direction of the hole.
Optimize difficulty : Balance the difficulty by managing the max size of the map and the number of special fields inside.
